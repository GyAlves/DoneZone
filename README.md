## üìñ About

The DoneZone API is a powerful and lightweight ToDo manager built entirely with Node.js, without relying on any external frameworks, and a file-based storage system. It empowers you to seamlessly keep track of your tasks, providing essential functionalities such as task listing, creation, updating, and deletion.
<b> With an additional feature : You can import your tasks in bulk by importing a CSV powered by streams. </b>

## üìù Key Features 

### Task Operations:

- <b>Listing: </b> Retrieve a comprehensive list of all your tasks.
- <b>Creation:</b> Easily create new tasks with relevant details.
- <b>Updating:</b> Modify task attributes to reflect changes.
- <b>Deletion:</b> Remove completed or unnecessary tasks effortlessly.

### CSV Import with Streams:

- <b>Bulk Import:</b> Using the multipart/form-data content type, you can upload a CSV file through an HTTP request. The server, configured to handle this content type, processes the incoming data as a stream. This allows efficient handling of large files without loading the entire content into memory at once.
